I am learning git and github in order to save my files in remote directory or in cloud. This github cloud helps us not only save our files it also tracks well and extension of files available. The github is good to manage by git server (software). More or less I become confident on making folders and files in git which is the local repository and through the help of git I am able to push the files into git hub.
